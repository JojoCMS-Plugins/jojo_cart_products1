Any images required by your plugin should be placed here. To call an image in the browser, simply link to http://example.com/images/name-of-image.jpg

If an image of the same name exists in the images folder of the current theme, then this will be given priority. If you don't want this to happen, choose names for your images that are relatively unique.

eg:
Unique names...
your-plugin-background.jpg
large-header.jpg

Not so unique names...
background.jpg
header.jpg

You can name images anything you like, but we recommend following these simple conventions for consistency with other Jojo plugins, but also because it makes sense.

-Only use lower case for image names. Linux web hosts are case sensitive and Background.jpg is not the same as background.jpg - even if you are on Windows now, it's best to stick with lower case in case you change to Linux later on.

-Use a dash "-" to separate words in images. Google recommends the dash as the separator, and so do we.

-Don't use spaces, as these are often encoded to "%20" which makes your filename look uggggly.

-Try to use descriptive names for your images. It makes management easier, and you may find your images start to rank in the search engines.
